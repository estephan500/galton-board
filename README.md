# galton-board
one of the lower quality Galton boards you will see

SCREEENHEIGHT and SCREENWIDTH may need adjusting.

This version of the Galton board, or "bean machine", is pretty weak in that if it runs long enough, the beans in the bottom bins spill out over their edges... well, then again, I guess a real-world one would also. But this one really sucks in other ways too. No energy to go into it here.
